## Code Explanation
- **HTML**:
    - The form is contained within a `div` with the class `container`.
    - It includes input fields for username and password, a checkbox for terms and conditions, and submit and register buttons.
    - The form uses the `post` method to send data to `login.php`.

- **CSS**:
    - The `.container` class styles the form container with a border, border-radius, padding, and a backdrop blur effect.
    - The `body` is styled to center the container and set a background image.
    - The `.input-box` class and its nested `input` elements are styled for better user experience.
    - Additional styling is applied to the checkbox, buttons, and links for a cohesive design.
